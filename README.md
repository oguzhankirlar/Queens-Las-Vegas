# Queens-Las-Vegas

Las Vegas algorithm for the n-queens problem

Run program for n=8. Empirically verify that the probability p for success is
around p=0.1293.

Write a program similar to QueensLasVegas that places a number k (k<8) of queens
on the board in a random way and then uses backtracking (the deterministic algorithm)
to place the remaining queens (without changing the positions of the queens that were
placed randomly).
